# Data Set Description

This documents describes in details the dataset dataC used in the paper. This dataset is from JD, one of China's biggest e-commerce companies, with billions of customers and humongous amount of real commercial data. This dataset is provided as part of a competition where the contestants are required to build a machine learning model to predict the purchase intention of customers. The dataset is extracted from real customers from the JD mall, including product and user action log information. The intention is to predict customer's intention to purchase certain products, to match customers with products they desire.

* Data includes daily users from 2016-02-01 to 2016-04-15 (group U), behaviour, comments and user action information towards products in group S, and potential product information in group P.
* Acronyms definition:
	* S: all products;
	* P: potential products, P is a subset of S;
	* U: all users;
	* A: users action towards products in S;
	* C: comment information of products in S.
 
* Data Tables:

## Local Feature Extraction

We adopt our in-house feature engineering tools [[2]](#2)[[3]](#3) on the production AutoML platform HyperCycleML [[4]](#4) to perform feature extraction. The configuration of the original dataset is described in [config.json](dataset/config.json). The detailed operations on the featues are summarized in [feql.script](dataset/feql.script). The operations are described in Feature Enginnering QL (FEQL), an in-house feature descitptive language.

The extracted features by the aforementioned feature engineering tools are logically divided into three sets, from the sub-tables the features are generated:

- Static features: original features and non-time-related extracted features.
- Time series group A: time series features generated with time windows constructed for Action Data.
- Time series group B: time series features generated with time windows constructed for user product interaction logs.
- TIme series group C: time series features generated with time windows constructed for Comments Data. 

| Group               | Feature Names                                                |

| Static features     | f_flattenRequest_bo_product_a1_direct_7, f_flattenRequest_bo_product_a2_direct_8, f_flattenRequest_bo_product_a3_direct_9, f_flattenRequest_bo_product_br_direct_10, f_flattenRequest_bo_product_cate_direct_11, f_flattenRequest_bo_user_age_direct_13, f_flattenRequest_bo_user_sex_direct_15, f_flattenRequest_bo_user_user_lv_cd_direct_16, f_original_pair_id_2, f_original_sku_id_3, f_combine_34_27, f_combine_35_29, f_combine_36_31, f_combine_37_34 |
| Time series group A | f_flattenRequest_bo_action_br_top3frequency_18, f_flattenRequest_bo_action_cate_top3frequency_19, f_flattenRequest_bo_action_model_id_top3frequency_20, f_flattenRequest_bo_action_type_top3frequency_21, f_flattenRequest_bo_action_model_id_distinct_count_24, f_flattenRequest_bo_action_model_id_distinct_count_25, f_flattenRequest_bo_action_type_distinct_count_26 |
| Time series group B | f_flattenRequest_window_unique_count_pair_id_30, f_flattenRequest_window_top1_ratio_pair_id_31, f_flattenRequest_window_top1_ratio_pair_id_32, f_flattenRequest_window_unique_count_pair_id_33, f_flattenRequest_window_count_pair_id_43, f_flattenRequest_window_count_pair_id_44 |
| Time series group C | f_flattenRequest_bo_comment_bad_comment_rate_avg_5, f_flattenRequest_bo_comment_bad_comment_rate_avg_6, f_flattenRequest_bo_comment_bad_comment_rate_min_17, f_flattenRequest_bo_comment_comment_num_distinct_count_27, f_flattenRequest_bo_comment_comment_num_distinct_count_28, f_flattenRequest_bo_comment_has_bad_comment_distinct_count_29 |

## Note

In federated time series feature extraction experiements, we assign Comments Data table to the collaborator. Thus time series group A and B are pregenerated in the Initiator, and time series group C is expected to be generated by the FTSFE process.
